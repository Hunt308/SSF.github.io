                <h1>About</h1>
                <p> Tory has been also approached by families of deceased surfers asking how they can honor the memory of their loved ones for whom surfing was a big part of their lives. It was from these seeds of mutual desire to give back and share the stoke of surfing that the idea of the Surf Station Foundation was born. </p>
                <p>In that spirit, we are proud to announce Surf Station Foundation, Inc., a 501 tax exempt public charity, evoking confidence, inspring environmental awareness, and improving the emotional and physical wellness of kids from disadvantaged and underserved communities and supporting the efforts of other 501 charities dedicated to helping others and to envirnomental conservation. </p>
                <p>The Foundations initial activities will include surf camp experiences for underprivileged youth and environmental programs, including ways to keep our ocean clear and pure.  “Every kid should have a chance to fall in love with the ocean like I did growing up here in St. Augustine. If a kid’s world ever feels out of balance, like mine did when my dad died when I was 13,  I want that kid to know he or she can find balance..on a wave!”</p>
